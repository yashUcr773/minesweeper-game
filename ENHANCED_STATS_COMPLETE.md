# Enhanced Stats Implementation Complete

## Summary

The issue where stats were not shown for all difficulties has been successfully resolved. The system now provides detailed statistics breakdown by difficulty level in addition to overall statistics.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Type Definitions (`src/types/game.ts`)
- ✅ Added `DifficultyStats` interface for per-difficulty statistics
- ✅ Enhanced `LeaderboardStats` interface to include `byDifficulty` field
- ✅ Properly typed all statistical data structures

### 2. Database Function Enhancement (`src/lib/database-prisma.ts`)
- ✅ Updated `getUserStats` function to calculate per-difficulty statistics
- ✅ Added proper aggregation for each difficulty level:
  - Total games played per difficulty
  - Best time per difficulty
  - Average time per difficulty  
  - Best score per difficulty
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing overall stats

### 3. Frontend UI Enhancement (`src/components/LeaderboardModal.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated component to use proper TypeScript typing
- ✅ Enhanced "My Stats" tab to display both:
  - **Overall Statistics**: Global stats across all difficulties
  - **Statistics by Difficulty**: Detailed breakdown for each difficulty played
- ✅ Added beautiful, responsive UI layout for difficulty-specific stats
- ✅ Maintained existing functionality while adding new features

### 4. API Integration (`src/app/api/leaderboard/stats/route.ts`)
- ✅ Confirmed API route correctly returns enhanced stats structure
- ✅ Proper authentication and error handling maintained

## Features Added

### Overall Statistics Section
- Total games played across all difficulties
- Best time overall
- Average time overall
- Favorite difficulty (most played)

### Per-Difficulty Statistics Section
- **For each difficulty played:**
  - Number of games completed
  - Best completion time
  - Average completion time
  - Best score achieved
- **Visual improvements:**
  - Each difficulty displayed in its own card
  - Color-coded statistics for easy reading
  - Responsive grid layout

## Database Structure
The enhanced statistics are calculated from existing leaderboard entries without requiring database schema changes. The system aggregates data on-demand to provide:

```typescript
interface LeaderboardStats {
  totalGames: number;
  bestTime: number;
  averageTime: number;
  winRate: number;
  favoriteDifficulty: Difficulty;
  byDifficulty: Record<string, DifficultyStats>;
}

interface DifficultyStats {
  totalGames: number;
  bestTime: number;
  averageTime: number;
  bestScore: number;
}
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (no errors)
- ✅ Database function correctly aggregates per-difficulty stats
- ✅ Frontend component properly displays enhanced statistics
- ✅ API integration working correctly
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Comprehensive View**: Users can now see their performance across all difficulty levels
2. **Detailed Insights**: Individual difficulty stats help users track progress
3. **Better UI**: Clean, organized presentation of statistical data
4. **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes

## Previous Issues Resolved
- ✅ **Duplicate Submissions**: Fixed with unique constraints and client-side tracking
- ✅ **Authentication**: JWT tokens properly handled for score submissions
- ✅ **Database Migration**: Successfully migrated from JSON to SQLite with Prisma
- ✅ **Stats Display**: Now shows comprehensive per-difficulty statistics

The minesweeper game now provides a complete, robust statistics system that gives users detailed insights into their performance across all difficulty levels while maintaining excellent user experience and data integrity.
