## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
```

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
  "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3", 
  "js-cookie": "^3.0.5",
  "@types/jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.6",
  "@types/bcryptjs": "^2.4.6",
  "@types/js-cookie": "^3.0.6"
}
```

## 🎯 Score Calculation Logic
```
Base Score = max(0, 999 - timeElapsed)
Difficulty Multipliers:
- Beginner: 1x
- Intermediate: 2x  
- Expert: 3x
- Master: 4x
- Insane: 5x
- Extreme: 6x

Final Score = Base Score × Difficulty Multiplier
```

## 🧪 Testing Status

### ✅ Completed Tests
- User registration and login flows
- Authentication persistence across sessions
- Score submission for winning games
- Leaderboard data display and filtering
- Personal statistics tracking
- Guest mode functionality
- Security validation (password hashing, JWT tokens)

### 🎮 Game Flow Integration
1. **Unauthenticated User**: Can play, view leaderboard, but scores not saved
2. **Authenticated User**: Full functionality with automatic score submission
3. **Score Submission**: Only on wins, non-custom games, for logged-in users
4. **Leaderboard**: Real-time updates, filterable by difficulty and time

## 🚀 Deployment Ready Features

### Production Considerations
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Secure password hashing
- ✅ JWT token authentication
