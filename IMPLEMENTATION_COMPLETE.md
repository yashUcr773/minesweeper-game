## 🎯 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Component Architecture**
```typescript
// Multi-stage animation system
const [animationStage, setAnimationStage] = useState(0);

// Performance rating calculation
const getPerformanceRating = () => {
  const efficiency = (cellsRevealed / totalSafeCells) * 100;
  const flagAccuracy = ((mines - incorrectFlags) / mines) * 100;
  const avgScore = (efficiency + flagAccuracy) / 2;
  // Returns rating object with icon and color
};

// New record detection
const isNewRecord = isWin && difficulty !== Difficulty.CUSTOM && 
  (bestTime === null || timeElapsed < bestTime);
```

### **Sound Integration**
```typescript
// Enhanced victory fanfare with multiple layers
modalVictoryFanfare() {
  // Main melody: C-E-G-C progression
  // Harmony layer with triangle waves  
  // Celebration sparkles at high frequencies
}

// Atmospheric defeat sound
modalDefeatSound() {
  // Descending melody: A-G-F-D with deep rumble
}
```

### **Auto-Show Logic**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (gameState.status === 'won' || gameState.status === 'lost') {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setShowWinLoss(true);
    }, gameState.status === 'lost' ? 1500 : 500); // Coordinate with bomb animations
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [gameState.status]);
```
