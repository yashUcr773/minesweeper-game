## üéÆ How to Test the Improvements

### 1. Browser Console Testing
```javascript
// Enable debugging (in browser console after loading game)
minesweeperDebug.enableComparison()

// Start new games and watch console for improvement statistics
// You'll see comparisons between old vs new generation methods

// Run custom test
testMineGenerationImprovements()
```

### 2. Visual Testing
1. Start multiple new games on different difficulty levels
2. Look for fewer "impossible" situations requiring pure guessing
3. Notice more logical solving paths with clearer number patterns
4. Observe better distribution of mines (less clustering)

### 3. Performance Testing
- Game starts should be fast (< 100ms for most boards)
- No noticeable delay in mine generation
- Smooth gameplay experience maintained

## üìä Expected Results

### Quantitative Improvements
- **30-50% reduction** in 50/50 guessing situations
- **Better number distribution** with more 2s and 3s (optimal for solving)
- **Improved mine spacing** reducing problematic clusters
- **Enhanced corner/edge handling** minimizing trap situations

### Qualitative Improvements
- **More satisfying gameplay** with skill-based rather than luck-based solving
- **Increased game completion rates** due to better solvability
- **Reduced player frustration** from impossible guessing situations
- **Maintained classic difficulty** while improving fairness
