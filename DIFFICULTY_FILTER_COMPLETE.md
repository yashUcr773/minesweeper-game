# Difficulty Filter for Overall Stats - Implementation Complete

## What Was Added

### 1. New State Variable
- Added `selectedStatsFilter` state to track which difficulty filter is selected
- Type: `'all' | Difficulty` to allow showing all difficulties or a specific one

### 2. Filtered Stats Function
- Created `getFilteredStats()` function that returns appropriate stats based on the selected filter
- **"All Difficulties"**: Returns overall stats (totalGames, bestTime, averageTime, favoriteDifficulty)
- **Specific Difficulty**: Returns stats for that difficulty only from `byDifficulty` object

### 3. Enhanced UI
- Added dropdown in the Overall Statistics section header
- **Dropdown Options**:
  - "All Difficulties" (default) - shows aggregate stats
  - Dynamic list of all difficulties the user has played (beginner, intermediate, expert, etc.)
- Proper labeling and styling consistent with existing design

### 4. Dynamic Stats Display
- Overall stats cards now update based on the selected filter
- **When "All Difficulties" selected**: Shows aggregate stats across all games
- **When specific difficulty selected**: Shows stats only for that difficulty
- Last card adapts its label:
  - "Favorite" (when showing all difficulties)
  - "Difficulty" (when filtering by specific difficulty)

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Users could only see overall aggregate stats
- No way to focus on specific difficulty performance

### After  
- Users can filter overall stats by any difficulty they've played
- Quick way to see performance for a specific difficulty level
- Dropdown automatically populates with only difficulties the user has actually played
- Maintains existing "Statistics by Difficulty" section for detailed breakdown

## Technical Features

### State Management
```typescript
const [selectedStatsFilter, setSelectedStatsFilter] = useState<'all' | Difficulty>('all');
```

### Smart Filtering Logic
- Handles cases where user hasn't played certain difficulties
- Graceful fallback to zero values for unplayed difficulties
- Type-safe implementation with proper TypeScript support

### Responsive Design
- Dropdown positioned nicely in the header area
- Maintains existing responsive grid layout for stats cards
- Consistent styling with other dropdowns in the component

## Integration
- Seamlessly integrates with existing enhanced stats system
- Uses the same `byDifficulty` data structure already implemented
- No changes needed to backend API or database functions
- Fully backward compatible

This enhancement provides users with granular control over their stats viewing experience while maintaining the comprehensive overview they already had.
