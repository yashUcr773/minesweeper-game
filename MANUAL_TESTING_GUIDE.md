## üéØ MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST

### Pre-Test Setup
- [x] Development server is running (npm run dev)
- [x] Database migrations are applied
- [x] Daily puzzle API is responding correctly
- [x] Application loads without errors

### Test Scenario 1: First Time User (No Previous Attempts)

1. **Open Application**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Daily Puzzle" button
   - ‚úÖ Modal should open showing fresh game board
   - ‚úÖ No attempt history should be visible
   - ‚úÖ Game should be playable

2. **Make First Failed Attempt**
   - Click on a cell that contains a mine (intentionally lose)
   - ‚úÖ Game should end with explosion animation
   - ‚úÖ "Try Again" button should appear
   - ‚úÖ No success message should show
   - ‚úÖ Attempt history should show "Attempt 1: Failed"

3. **Verify Try Again Functionality**
   - Click "Try Again" button
   - ‚úÖ Fresh game board should appear
   - ‚úÖ Previous attempt should still show in history
   - ‚úÖ Game should be fully playable again

### Test Scenario 2: Multiple Failed Attempts

4. **Make Second Failed Attempt**
   - Play and lose again (click on a mine)
   - ‚úÖ "Try Again" button should appear again
   - ‚úÖ Attempt history should show:
     - "Attempt 1: Failed"
     - "Attempt 2: Failed"

5. **Make Third Failed Attempt**
   - Repeat the process
   - ‚úÖ Attempt history should show all 3 failed attempts
   - ‚úÖ "Try Again" button should still be available

### Test Scenario 3: Successful Completion After Failed Attempts

6. **Complete the Puzzle Successfully**
   - Click "Try Again" and play carefully
   - Complete the puzzle without hitting mines
   - ‚úÖ Success message should appear
   - ‚úÖ Time and score should be displayed
   - ‚úÖ Leaderboard rank should be shown
   - ‚úÖ Attempt history should show all previous attempts plus the successful one
   - ‚úÖ "Try Again" button should still be available

7. **Verify Leaderboard Entry**
   - Note the completion time and attempt number
   - Check that leaderboard shows this as the entry (not a better later attempt)
   - ‚úÖ Leaderboard should show FIRST successful attempt, not best time

### Test Scenario 4: Multiple Attempts After Success

8. **Try Again After Success**
   - Click "Try Again" button
   - ‚úÖ Fresh game should start
   - ‚úÖ Previous completion should still show in history
   - ‚úÖ Leaderboard position should remain the same

9. **Complete Again with Better Time**
   - Play and complete faster than the first successful attempt
   - ‚úÖ Better time should be recorded as a new attempt
   - ‚úÖ Leaderboard position should NOT change (still shows first success)
   - ‚úÖ Attempt history should show both successful attempts

### Test Scenario 5: API and Data Verification

10. **Check API Response**
    - Open browser developer tools
    - Go to Network tab
    - Refresh the daily puzzle modal
    - Find the `/api/daily-puzzle` request
    - ‚úÖ Response should include:
      - `userEntry`: First successful completion (if any)
      - `userAttempts`: Array of all attempts
      - `leaderboard`: List showing only first successful attempts per user

### Test Scenario 6: Edge Cases

11. **Close and Reopen Modal**
    - Close the daily puzzle modal
    - Reopen it
    - ‚úÖ All attempt history should persist
    - ‚úÖ Current state should be maintained

12. **Refresh Page**
    - Refresh the entire page
    - Open daily puzzle modal
    - ‚úÖ All data should persist from database
    - ‚úÖ Attempt history should be complete

### Expected Behavior Summary

**What Should Work:**
- ‚úÖ Users can attempt the daily puzzle multiple times
- ‚úÖ Each attempt is recorded with its own attempt number
- ‚úÖ Failed attempts show "Try Again" button
- ‚úÖ Successful attempts show completion details + "Try Again" button
- ‚úÖ Attempt history displays all attempts with status
- ‚úÖ Leaderboard shows only FIRST successful completion per user
- ‚úÖ Multiple successes don't change leaderboard position
- ‚úÖ All data persists across page refreshes

**What Should NOT Happen:**
- ‚ùå Users should NOT be blocked from additional attempts
- ‚ùå Leaderboard should NOT update with better later attempts
- ‚ùå Attempt history should NOT be lost
- ‚ùå Database should NOT have unique constraint errors

### Troubleshooting

**If "Try Again" button doesn't appear:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify DailyPuzzleModal.tsx has been updated correctly
- Check that the blocking condition has been removed

**If attempt history doesn't show:**
- Verify API returns userAttempts array
- Check that getUserDailyPuzzleAttempts function works
- Ensure database allows multiple entries per user/puzzle

**If leaderboard shows wrong attempt:**
- Verify getDailyPuzzleLeaderboard function filters correctly
- Check that it uses ROW_NUMBER() with ORDER BY attemptNumber
- Ensure only success=true entries are considered
