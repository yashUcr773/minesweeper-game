# Multiple Attempts for Daily Puzzles - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented the ability for users to retry daily puzzles multiple times while maintaining leaderboard integrity by only counting the first successful completion for rankings.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
- **No unique constraints**: Removed any unique constraints on user+puzzle combinations to allow unlimited attempts
- **Simple schema**: Using the original DailyPuzzleEntry schema without additional complexity

### 2. Database Functions (`src/lib/database-prisma.ts`)

#### New Function Added:
```typescript
export async function getUserDailyPuzzleAttempts(userId: string, puzzleId: string): Promise<DailyPuzzleEntry[]>
```
- Returns all attempts for a user on a specific puzzle, ordered by most recent first
- Used for displaying attempt history in the UI

#### Modified Functions:
- **`submitDailyPuzzleScore()`**: Now allows unlimited submissions without checking for duplicates
- **`getDailyPuzzleLeaderboard()`**: Uses client-side filtering to show only first successful completion per user
- **`getUserDailyPuzzleEntry()`**: Returns first successful completion or most recent attempt

### 3. API Updates (`src/app/api/daily-puzzle/route.ts`)
- **Added import**: `getUserDailyPuzzleAttempts`
- **Enhanced response**: Now includes `userAttempts` array with all user attempts
- **Maintains compatibility**: Existing `userEntry` field still works for the best/first completion

### 4. Type Definitions (`src/types/game.ts`)
```typescript
export interface DailyPuzzleLeaderboard {
  puzzle: DailyPuzzle;
  leaderboard: DailyPuzzleEntry[];
  userEntry?: DailyPuzzleEntry;
  userAttempts?: DailyPuzzleEntry[];  // NEW: All user attempts
  rank?: number;
}
```

### 5. UI Components (`src/components/DailyPuzzleModal.tsx`)

#### Major UI Changes:
1. **Removed blocking logic**: Users can now play multiple times even after completion
2. **Enhanced completion UI**: Shows best result, rank, and attempt history
3. **Failed attempts UI**: Shows previous failed attempts with "Try Again" button
4. **Game state management**: Properly handles restarting games for retry attempts

#### New UI Features:
- **Attempt history display**: Shows numbered attempts with success/failure status
- **Best result highlighting**: Clearly shows which attempt was the best
- **Try Again functionality**: Easy restart for both completed and failed attempts
- **Clear messaging**: Users understand only first success counts for leaderboard

## Implementation Strategy

### Leaderboard Integrity
- **Database level**: No unique constraints to allow multiple submissions
- **Application level**: `getDailyPuzzleLeaderboard()` filters to first successful completion per user
- **UI level**: Clear messaging that only first success counts for ranking

### User Experience
1. **First-time users**: Normal puzzle experience
2. **After completion**: Can see their best result and try to improve
3. **After failures**: Can see attempt history and retry unlimited times
4. **Leaderboard**: Always shows only the first successful completion per user

### Data Flow
1. User plays puzzle → Multiple attempts allowed
2. Each attempt creates new `DailyPuzzleEntry` record
3. API returns both `userEntry` (best/first completion) and `userAttempts` (all attempts)
4. UI shows appropriate interface based on user's attempt status
5. Leaderboard filters to show only first successful completion per user

## Benefits
- ✅ **Unlimited retries**: Users can practice and improve
- ✅ **Fair leaderboard**: Only first success counts for rankings
- ✅ **Attempt tracking**: Users can see their progress over multiple tries
- ✅ **Smooth UX**: Clear interfaces for different attempt states
- ✅ **Data integrity**: Robust filtering ensures leaderboard accuracy

## Testing Considerations
1. **Multiple attempts**: Verify users can submit unlimited attempts
2. **Leaderboard filtering**: Ensure only first completion per user appears
3. **UI states**: Test completed, failed, and mixed attempt scenarios
4. **Data persistence**: Verify attempt history is maintained
5. **Performance**: Leaderboard filtering should handle large datasets

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation thoroughly with real users
2. Monitor database performance with multiple attempts
3. Consider adding attempt statistics (success rate, average time, etc.)
4. Potentially add daily/weekly attempt limits if needed for performance

The implementation successfully removes the 1-time limit while maintaining leaderboard integrity through application-level filtering rather than database constraints.
